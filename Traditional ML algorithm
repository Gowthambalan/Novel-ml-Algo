Unsupervised Learning---------

Supervised Learning: As the name implies, supervised learning involves the presence of a supervisor who also serves as an instructor. 
Supervised learning is when we educate or train a computer using well-labeled data, which implies that part of the data has already been tagged with the correct answer.

Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning is the process of teaching a computer to act on information that is neither classed nor labeled. 
The machineâ€™s objective here is to sort unsorted data into groups based on patterns and similarities without any prior data training.

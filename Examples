Emergency wait time – Discrete Event Simulation is a technology used by health tech firms and healthcare organizations to anticipate wait times for patients in the emergency department waiting rooms. To anticipate wait times, the algorithms take into account elements such as staffing levels, patient data, emergency department records, and even the structure of the emergency room itself.

Hearth failures – Heart failure diagnostic criteria may now be extracted from free-text medical notes, according to IBM researchers. 
They created a machine learning system that scans physicians’ free-form text notes (in electronic health records) and synthesizes the content using a process known as NLP- Natural Language Processing. 
Computers can now perform what a cardiologist can do by reading another physician’s notes and determining whether a patient has heart failure.

Employee access control– Amazon, a pioneer of machine-learning-based recommendation engines and pricing discrimination algorithms, 
held a Kaggle machine learning competition to see if it was possible to automate employee access giving and revocation. 
Amazon has a large database of employee jobs and access levels. They’re working on a computer program to anticipate which staff should be given access to which resources.

Software and the internet revolutionized company practices in the 1990s and 2000s. Amazon and Google, 
two cutting-edge, tech-savvy firms, developed quickly. Blockbuster and Borders, both old and stodgy corporations, we’re unable to keep up.
